# **The basics**

**The so called "Entities" are creatures that you can encounter on your journey through the facility.**
<br>
<br>
There are multiple types of entities, some may be hostile and some friendly. Entities can generally be categorized by a so called "Danger Level" which pretty much describes how much of a threat they are to you. The various entities that you can encounter throughout the facility all have different kinds of abilities and behaviour. But dont worry, all of them are explained on the following pages.

## **Entity types**
Entities can be categorized in four different categories, those being **Passive**, **Hostile**, **Disasters** and **Creations**.

### **Passive Entities**
Passive entities are entities that pose no direct towards the player. They are usually here to help the player and may even prove to be an advantage. The entitity [**Luna**](Passive/luna.md) is an example for a passive entity, as she can be found in break floors and provides the player with valuable goods that they can exchange for credits.

### **Hostile Entities**
Hostile entities are entities that pose a threat to the player. They can be found throughout the entire facility and the player should try to avoid them at all cost. The hostile entities all have their own behavior that can be studied and understood to avoid receiving damage from them. Examples for hostile entities are [**Zera**](Hostile/zera.md), [**Xhase**](Hostile/xhase.md) or [**Snatcher**](Hostile/snatcher.md).

### **Disasters**
Disasters are entities or events that are so powerful that they pose a threat to the player and the facility itself. The disasters often have their own "encounter floor" *(with [**Chronos**](Disasters/chronos.md) being an exception).* and the player receives a generous reward for beating such floors. The current Disasters are [**Burnout**](Disasters/burnout.md), [**Chronos**](Disasters/chronos.md) and [**Hemorrhage**](Disasters/hemorrhage.md).

### **Creations**
If an Entity is classified as a "Creation", it was created in this very facility. Currently, all creations are hostile and will cause harm to the player if encountered and not avoided. Creation entities can have many appearances, an example is [**Greed**](Hostile/Creations/greed.md) who appears as a greenish glitch effect on seemingly normal items. Players can easily avoid taking damage from these entities if they know how the entity behaves. Examples for entities classified as "Creations" are [**Bazil**](Hostile/Creations/bazil.md), [**Soleil**](Hostile/Creations/soleil.md) or [**Bacterium**](Hostile/Creations/bacterium.md).
