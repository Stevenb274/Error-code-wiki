# The basics

**The so called "Entities" are creatures that you can encounter on your journey through the facility.**
<br>

There are multiple types of entities, some may be hostile and some friendly. Entities can generally be categorized by a so called "Danger Level" which pretty much describes how much of a threat they are to you. The various entities that you can encounter throughout the facility all have different kinds of abilities and behaviour. But dont worry, all of them are explained on the following pages.
