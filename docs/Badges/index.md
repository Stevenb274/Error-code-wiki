Badges can be categorized in three different categories, those being **Game Related**, **Entity Related** and **Combos**.

### **Game Related Badges**
Game Related Badges are the easiest ones to obtain, as most of the time. You can obtain them without even knowing. [**welcome**](Game-Related/welcome.md) is an example for a game-related badge, as you can obtain it by just joining the game.

### **COMBOS**
"**This is the hardest of them all!**"
