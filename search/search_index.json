There are multiple types of entities, some may be hostile and some friendly. Entities can generally be categorized by a so called \"Danger Level\" which pretty much describes how much of a threat they are to you. The various entities that you can encounter throughout the facility all have different kinds of abilities and behaviour. But dont worry, all of them are explained on the following pages.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/#entity-types","title":"Entity types","text":"<p>Entities can be categorized in four different categories, those being Passive, Hostile, Disasters and Creations.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/#passive-entities","title":"Passive Entities","text":"<p>Passive entities are entities that pose no direct towards the player. They are usually here to help the player and may even prove to be an advantage. The entitity Luna is an example for a passive entity, as she can be found in break floors and provides the player with valuable goods that they can exchange for credits.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/#hostile-entities","title":"Hostile Entities","text":"<p>Hostile entities are entities that pose a threat to the player. They can be found throughout the entire facility and the player should try to avoid them at all cost. The hostile entities all have their own behavior that can be studied and understood to avoid receiving damage from them. Examples for hostile entities are Zera, Xhase or Snatcher.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/#disasters","title":"Disasters","text":"<p>Disasters are entities or events that are so powerful that they pose a threat to the player and the facility itself. The disasters often have their own \"encounter floor\" (with Chronos being an exception). and the player receives a generous reward for beating such floors. The current Disasters are Burnout, Chronos and Hemorrhage.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/#creations","title":"Creations","text":"<p>If an Entity is classified as a \"Creation\", it was created in this very facility. Currently, all creations are hostile and will cause harm to the player if encountered and not avoided. Creation entities can have many appearances, an example is Greed who appears as a greenish glitch effect on seemingly normal items. Players can easily avoid taking damage from these entities if they know how the entity behaves. Examples for entities classified as \"Creations\" are Bazil, Soleil or Bacterium.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Roxy/","title":"Roxy","text":"<p>\"A hot mess without the hotness\"</p> <p> </p> The hot mess without the hotness"},{"location":"Entities/Creations/adrenaline/","title":"Adrenaline","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Creations/bacterium/","title":"Bacterium","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Creations/bazil/","title":"Bazil","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Creations/greed/","title":"Greed","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Creations/soleil/","title":"Soleil?","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Creations/weepingangel/","title":"Weeping Angel","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Disasters/burnout/","title":"Burnout","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Disasters/chronos/","title":"Chronos","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Disasters/hemorrhage/","title":"Hemorrhage","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p> <p>Aw hell naw WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?</p> <p>You have doomed us all</p> <p>Alerta    Anyways yea first custom theme page lmao</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Hostile/blaster/","title":"Blaster","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Hostile/snatcher/","title":"Snatcher","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Hostile/xhase/","title":"Xhase","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Hostile/zera/","title":"Zera","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"Entities/Passive/luna/","title":"Luna","text":"<p>WIP Page</p> <p>This page is marked as WIP, meaning that changes may happen to this page every once in a while and that content may not be final.</p>"},{"location":"internal/page_locked/","title":"Page locked","text":"<p>The page you tried to access is currently locked and cannot be accessed.</p>"}]}
