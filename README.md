# Error_code Wiki

Welcome, this is the Error_code Wiki but as a bunch of css and markdown. This is being used to create and display the Error_code Wiki for all of those who are interested in wanting to know more about the game or for those who need help.

## Contributing to the Wiki

### Getting started
In order to contribute, you need to have simple knownledge about markdown *(occassionally about mkdocs or css aswell, depending on what you want to add)* and you need to have a github account.
<br>
<br>
If you do not directly have edit access to this source then you need to create a fork of this repository. Once you have created the fork, you may edit your own fork however you want and add/remove/change content to your liking.
<br>
<br>
After you have finished what you wanted to contribute, you can create a pull request by pressing the "Contribute" button on your own fork which will prompt you to create a pull request.
<br>

### Pull requests

When creating a pull request, please make sure to give it a reasonable title & a *somewhat* descriptive text so we know what you want to add and **why**. *(You can find the edits you have made at the very bottom of the pull request creation page)*
<br>
<br>
Once your pull request has been created *(if it doesnt collide with any rulesets)*, you will have to wait for a maintainer to inspect and approve/deny your changes.
<br>
<br>
When your change has been approved, your branch and the main branch will be merged and the wiki should automaticly update within a few minutes.

### What to remember

**PLEASE** always make sure that your fork is up-to-date with the main branch. You can ensure this by using the "Sync fork" button on your fork *(Github will tell you if your branch is lacking updates)*.
<br>
<br>
Make sure to keep things organized and well structured. We dont want this to be messy.
<br>
<br>
You are allowed to ping Wiki Maintainers within the discord server to draw their attention towards your pull request!
